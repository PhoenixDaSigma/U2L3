1. It should be updated in self.place_token. In Tic-Tac-Toe, shapes are placed during a turn, so self.place_token should be used during a turn.

2. I could index the cells of the list using a number 1-9, and access those cells based on a line of user input. For this, it would be a long if statement, but it would definitely work well.

3. __check_win() should be called from the is_winner() function. is_winner just returns if the player has won or not, so its entire purpose is to use __check_win(). It should have the board as an argument to check for win conditions.

4. The user input function would make it so the user can input their tile choice. Also, a function for the computer to play is absolutely necessary, so the player has an opponent to play against. It should return the computer's move so the board can be updated.

5. I was going to just put a big if statement detailing all the win conditions.
